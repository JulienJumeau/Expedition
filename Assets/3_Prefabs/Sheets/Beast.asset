  _sheetText: "To all members of the expedition \\n\\n  Something horrible happened
    yesterday, a few scientists died. We will bear the grief of their death, they
    were killed by some animals. These beasts are photosensitive it is possible to
    scare them away with a powerful enough light source, lantern\u2019s light don\u2019t
    suffice however. They also seem to be blind or at least they have really bad eyes
    so avoid making any sound if you have to confront them as they can hear you quite
    easily. \\n\\n  Miskatonic\u2019s expedition team \\n\\n"
