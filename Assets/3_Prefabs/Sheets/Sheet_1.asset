  _sheetText: Antartica 1/6/1931\n\n  Dr Niels Evans's expedition diary\n\n  We got
    here two weeks ago with the last shipment.\n\n An outpost has been set in the
    entrance of a series of galleries found earlier this week.\n\n  I must say that
    I'm really excited about what we will be able to discover inside this mountain
    and I sure hope to see my name on the next great paper about our discoveries.
    I heard that the guys working in the snow outside the galleries just found something
    big they talked about big corpses found in the ice... it seems that some of them
    were in particularly good shape. I can't wait to get my eyes on these tomorrow.\n\n  This
    expedition is gonna lauch my career. I can feel it.
