  _sheetText: "9 January 1931 \\n\\n Dr. Niels Evans\u2019s expedition diary \\n\\n
    \ We are fucked \\n\\n  We were setting the dynamite up when we heard some noises
    in the west galleries, as we were all going there to witness what was happening,
    we found the dead corpses of three scientists they were devastated by something
    bigger and more dangerous than the penguins and noises were starting to be heard
    in the east galleries\u2026 this was a really bad idea to come here. \\n\\n"
