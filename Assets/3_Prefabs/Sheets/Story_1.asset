  _sheetText: "8 January 1931 \\n\\n Dr. Niels Evans\u2019s expedition diary \\n\\n
    \ I\u2019ve seen the corpses, these things are monsters. I can\u2019t even describe
    what it looks like, I couldn\u2019t handle their sight for too long. But this
    is an incredible discovery some guys even started to call them \u201Cancients\u201D
    but something feels kinda off. \\n\\n  The excavation is going well, we found
    a big network of galleries and tunnels inside the mountain. Some ways are long
    lost but a lot of these tunnels are still usable. We are gonna need to make our
    way through a pile of rubble blocking the way, that good old dynamite stick will
    be of great help here sparing us a few days of work. \\n\\n"
